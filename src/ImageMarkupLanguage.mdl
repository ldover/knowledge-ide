# Image Markup Language
Image Markup Language is a programming framework for developing images with syntax for communicating with libraries of machine learning models. Just like {WritingMarkupLanguage} is used to develop text.

## Example
This is the famous image [DALLE•E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) generated from the following input:
> “A propaganda poster depicting a cat dressed as French emperor Napoleon holding a piece of cheese”

Provided the right ML libraries exist, {ImageMarkupLanguage} could express the same intent as:
```jsx
import Cat from 'libs/animals';
import Poster from 'libs/artefacts';
import Person from 'libs/people';

<Poster style={'propaganda'}>
	<Person name={'Napoleon'}>
		<Person.Face from={Cat}/>
	</Person>
</Poster>
```

# Web IDE
Web IDE for developing and publishing articles. You can always use the latest release of the web app [here](https://ide.lukadover.com).

To develop locally:
```
cd app
npm run dev
```

## Why code your own IDE instead of writing a plugin for VSCode?
Valid question. There are a few reasons:
* Freedom to experiment beyond the typical constraints of plugin APIs 
* Allowing non-engineers to play around with a free-to-use web IDE without having to install VSCode 
* Personal education

At some future point, when MDL and KDL are more fleshed out frameworks, developing a plugin will probably make much more sense.
